## Problem
### Free and Unfettered Media
The vast majority of free online entertainment is supported through advertising,
the revenue from which allows content creators to be compensated for their
hard work. The problem lies in the fact that advertisers have their own goals in
mind when selecting which content creators to work with. This means that
creators who present certain forms of media are more greatly compensated
than others. We believe it is in everyone’s interest to have media that is not
solely controlled by big corporations or private entities.

### Community Ownership and Representation 
The second part of providing free and unrestricted media is ensuring interested
parties can stand to gain from supporting creators. While social media giants
such as Google and Facebook benefit from the growth of online entertainment, it
stands to reason that the users of those platforms should benefit similarly.
What if a creator wants the value of their audience to appreciate much like the 
3
shares of the platform they use do? Or an investor would like to benefit from the
future growth of online media but is unsure of which platforms will be the most
popular?

## Solution

With Vodra, there will be a new and unprecedented way for content creators,
their audiences and any others who believe in free and open media to benefit
from its growth. Vodra is a decentralized digital currency, or cryptocurrency,
that fully represents and supports content creators and their audiences. With a
representative free-market value for creators’ audience sizes, equitable
compensation can be achieved. Those who consume and enjoy free online media can support
the medium by using Vodra to donate to a creator, or to vote on and contribute to upcoming projects.
Even those who do not consume free online media but recognize the growth
potential can utilize Vodra as a powerful investment tool. While certain media
companies and their associated stock prices are bound to rise and fall
unpredictably, the stable yet rapid growth of online audiences can now be
directly invested in.

## Token Redemption
Vodra is a simple ERC-20 token, that is redeemed based on content creator audience sizes. Vodra is redeemed at a diminishing rate, allowing for our the fixed supply of tokens to last while the community grows, and ensuring that those who participate early in Vodra’s growth will be rewarded at a higher rate.

## Uses
The token itself is designed to be simple, and usable in any wallet that accepts Ethereum. Many of the core uses of the token will be implemented on our website, which hosts the Creator Program.

Vodra is the perfect solution to directly support content creators without requiring a third party. Most entertainment streaming platforms allow viewers to donate to broadcasters, but they take a massive cut. Vodra keeps the transactions between viewers and creators on their own terms. Vodra will be used for direct donations, as well as integrations with popular broadcasting software.

The Creator Program on our website will host user profiles, and act as an index for content creators "social media footprint". Audience members will be able to vote on and contribute to upcoming projects from their favorite content creators using Vodra.

Using its unique redemption process, and interactions between audience members and content creators, Vodra aims to put a fair value on the worth of an audience member. This allows users to invest in the growth of online entertainement, without targeting any specific platform.
