# Vodra - Crypto Meets Content
## Problem
### Free and Unfettered Media
The vast majority of free online entertainment is supported through advertising,
the revenue from which allows content creators to be compensated for their
hard work. The problem lies in the fact that advertisers have their own goals in
mind when selecting which content creators to work with. This means that
creators who present certain forms of media are more greatly compensated
than others. We believe it is in everyone’s interest to have media that is not
solely controlled by big corporations or private entities.

### Community Ownership and Representation 
The second part of providing free and unrestricted media is ensuring interested
parties can stand to gain from supporting creators. While social media giants
such as Google and Facebook benefit from the growth of online entertainment, it
stands to reason that the users of those platforms should benefit similarly.
What if a creator wants the value of their audience to appreciate much like the 
3
shares of the platform they use do? Or an investor would like to benefit from the
future growth of online media but is unsure of which platforms will be the most
popular?

## Solution

With Vodra, there will be a new and unprecedented way for content creators,
their audiences and any others who believe in free and open media to benefit
from its growth. Vodra is a decentralized digital currency, or cryptocurrency,
that fully represents and supports content creators and their audiences. With a
representative free-market value for creators’ audience sizes, equitable
compensation can be demanded for advertisements, product placements or
promotions. Those who consume and enjoy free online media can also support
the medium by using Vodra to purchase merchandise or donate to a creator.
Even those who do not consume free online media but recognize the growth
potential can utilize Vodra as a powerful investment tool. While certain media
companies and their associated stock prices are bound to rise and fall
unpredictably, the stable yet rapid growth of online audiences can now be
directly invested in.
